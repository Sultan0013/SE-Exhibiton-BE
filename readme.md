# Exhibition Curation Platform - Back-End üöÄ

Hello Sultan! üëë

Welcome to the back-end of the Exhibition Curation Platform. This service powers our interactive art exhibition platform by securely integrating multiple museum APIs and handling all data operations with robust error handling and user feedback.

- **Secure API Integration:** Connects to multiple APIs with proper key management.
- **Robust Error Handling:** Provides clear error messages and loading indicators.
- **RESTful Endpoints:** Facilitates operations such as creating, updating, and retrieving user collections.
- **Simple Environment Setup:** Easily configured using a straightforward `.env` file.
